# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD-POWER-BI
Hello everyone!
I have created interactive Dashboard on HR Analytics using Power BI.

## **Project Objective**
By using data-driven insights, help an organization by enhancing staff performance, increasing employee retention, and lowering attrition.

## **Getting Started**
To view and interact with the dashboard, you'll need **Power BI Desktop**. You can download and install it from the Microsoft Store or by following this link(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494).

## **Data Source**

The sales data is stored in CSV format. The following steps were followed in the project:

1. **Extract the Data**:
 The sales data was extracted from the provided CSV files.
2. **Transform the Data**:
 Power BI's Power Query editor was utilized to transform and clean the raw data, making it suitable for analysis.
3. **Load the Data in Power BI**:
 The transformed data was loaded into Power BI for visualization and analysis.

## **Performance Indicators (KPIs)** â€“ 
1.    Count of employees
2.    Attrition figures
3.    Attrition rate
4.    Average age of employees
5.    Average salary of employees
6.    Average year of employees at the company

## **Dashboard**

## **Project Insight**
1.    The attrition rate is higher in Life Sciences Education which is 38%.
2.    Maximum attrition happening in the age group 26-35.
3.    The attrition rate seems to be high after working for a year in the company.
4.    The attrition rate is highest for employees who are paid up to 5K.
5.    Attrition is directly proportional to job satisfaction as well for different job roles. Hence lower the number, the more chances of attrition.
6.    A laboratory technician's position has the highest attrition rate, i.e. 62.
7. The attrition rate is higher for male employees than for female employees.

By providing these insights, the dashboard enables HR managers to take proactive measures to retain top talent, manage attrition, and create a more productive work environment.

## **Project Learning**

During the course of this project, the following key skills and techniques were utilized:

1. **Interactive Dashboard Creation**:

2. **Advanced Visualization Techniques**:
Implemented complex parameters, filters, and slicers to enable dynamic and detailed data exploration.
3. **Data Manipulation and Calculation**:

4. **Customized Visualizations**:
Utilized various customized visualizations such as bar charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, slicers, etc., to present data effectively.
